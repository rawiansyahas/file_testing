        'solution': 'To prevent late blight, use varieties resistant to the disease. Keep plants healthy and stressed plants are more predisposed to late blight. Avoid overhead irrigation and do not dig tubers until they are fully mature to prevent damage. Rotate crops and avoid planting potatoes or tomatoes in the same location for at least two years. Keep the field at least 225 to 450 yards away from last years field and surround the field with wheat to keep wind-blown spores from entering.
